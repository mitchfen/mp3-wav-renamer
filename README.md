# renameMyMusic.py

I am writing this python script to help me organize my mess of a music library.  
I have a lot of songs with random or unintuitive names. This program reads each file into an array, then iterates through them and plays each one.  

Each song in the specified directory is played until a keyboard interupt or the song ends, at which point the user is asked to rename the song or delete it.
