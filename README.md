# renameMyMusic.py

I am writing this python script to help me organize my mess of a music library.  

I have a lot of songs with random or unintuitive names. This program reads each file into an array, then iterates through them and plays each one.  

Songs are played for 15 seconds at which point the program will prompt me for input or to continue play. Then I can input a name I'd like the file to have and it will be moved into a "sorted" folder.
